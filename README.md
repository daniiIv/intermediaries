This React component, App, is responsible for displaying various statistics and sales data related to an insurance company. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. State Variables:

-- companyProfit: State variable to store the company's profit.
-- statistics: State variable to store general statistics data.
-- salesl2l3: State variable to store sales data.
-- products: State variable to store product-related statistics.

2. UseEffect Hooks:

-- Three useEffect hooks are used to establish connections to server-sent event (SSE) endpoints to fetch statistics and sales data.
-- Each hook subscribes to an SSE endpoint, listens for data, and updates the corresponding state variables accordingly.
-- The hooks are triggered only once upon component mounting due to the empty dependency arrays ([]).

3. Formatting Function:

-- formatValue: Function to format numerical values to display with two decimal places and localized formatting.

4. Rendering:

-- The component is divided into several sections using Bootstrap grid layout classes.
-- The first section displays company statistics such as profit, number of sales, and premium income.
-- The second section displays product-related statistics in a table format, showing the product title and the count of products sold.
-- The third section displays detailed sales data in a table, including sale number, intermediary title, product title, premium calculated, commission calculated, sales date, and company profit.

5. EventSource Handling:

-- EventSource objects are used to establish connections to SSE endpoints.
-- Upon receiving data from the SSE endpoints, the respective state variables are updated to reflect the latest data.
-- Error handling is implemented to log any SSE errors and close the event sources in case of errors.

Overall, this component provides a dynamic and real-time view of various statistics and sales data related to the insurance company, continuously updating as new data is received from the server.
